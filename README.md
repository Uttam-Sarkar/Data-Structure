6.S191 software labs are designed to be compeleted at your own pace. At the end of each of the labs, there will be intructions on how you can submit your notebook for grade.Additionally, if you would like to submit your lab as part of the 6.S191 lab competitions, instructions regrading what information must be submitted must be also provided at the end of each lab.
